# MoodflixMobile Project Documentation

## Project Overview

MoodflixMobile is a React Native mobile application that provides movie recommendations based on user moods. The app allows users to browse movies, get personalized recommendations, and engage with social features including a Watch Party functionality for synchronized movie watching with friends.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Directory Structure
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/contexts`: React Context providers for state management
- `/src/screens`: Screen components for the application
- `/src/services`: Service classes for API interactions and business logic
- `/src/hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `/src/navigation`: Navigation configuration
- `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/constants`: Application constants
- `/src/config`: Configuration files
- `/src/features`: Feature-specific components and logic

### State Management
The application uses React Context API for state management with the following contexts:
- `AuthContext`: Manages user authentication state
- `ThemeContext`: Manages theme preferences
- `SocialContext`: Manages social features state

### API Integration
The application integrates with:
- TMDB API for movie data
- Supabase for backend services including authentication, database, and real-time features

## Features

### Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Login, registration, and profile management
- **Movie Browsing**: Browse popular movies and search for specific titles
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about movies
- **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Get movie recommendations based on your current mood
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Receive recommendations based on watch history and preferences
- **Offline Mode**: Access cached content when offline
- **Dark/Light Theme Support**: Toggle between dark and light themes

### Social Features
- **Friend System**: Add friends, manage friend requests, and view friend profiles
- **Activity Feed**: See what movies your friends are watching and their reactions
- **Profile Sharing**: Share your profile with others

### Watch Party Feature
- **Synchronized Playback**: Watch movies together with friends in real-time
- **Chat Functionality**: Chat with participants during the watch party
- **Participant Management**: See who's watching and invite friends to join

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
Authentication is implemented using Supabase Auth with JWT tokens. The `AuthContext` manages the authentication state and provides methods for login, registration, and logout.

### Movie Data
Movie data is fetched from TMDB API using the `movieService`. The service includes methods for fetching popular movies, searching movies, and getting movie details.

### Mood-Based Recommendations
The `moodService` analyzes user preferences and movie metadata to provide mood-based recommendations. It uses a combination of genre matching, keyword analysis, and rating filters.

### Offline Support
The `offlineService` manages data caching and network state detection. It provides methods for caching data, retrieving cached data, and subscribing to network changes.

### Social Features
Social features are implemented using Supabase Realtime for real-time updates. The `friendService` and `activityService` handle friend connections and activity tracking.

### Watch Party
The Watch Party feature uses Supabase Realtime for synchronizing playback state and chat messages. The `watchPartyService` manages the creation, joining, and state updates of watch parties.

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Optimization
- Uses Expo Image for efficient image loading and caching
- Implements progressive loading for large images
- Applies proper image sizing to reduce memory usage

### API Optimization
- Implements request batching to reduce API calls
- Uses caching strategies to minimize redundant requests
- Applies proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### UI Performance
- Implements lazy loading for components and screens
- Uses React.memo for component memoization
- Optimizes list rendering with proper key usage and virtualization

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are implemented for components and services using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Integration Tests
Integration tests verify the interaction between different parts of the application.

### End-to-End Tests
End-to-end tests simulate user interactions to ensure the application works as expected.

## Deployment

### iOS Deployment
The application is configured for iOS deployment with:
- Proper Info.plist configuration
- LaunchScreen.storyboard for splash screen
- Required permission declarations

### Android Deployment
The application is configured for Android deployment with:
- Proper AndroidManifest.xml configuration
- Splash screen implementation
- Required permission declarations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Implement advanced recommendation algorithms using machine learning
- Add video playback analytics for better recommendations
- Implement content moderation for user-generated content
- Add support for multiple languages
- Implement accessibility features for users with disabilities

### Scalability Considerations
- Optimize database queries for larger user bases
- Implement caching strategies for high-traffic scenarios
- Consider serverless functions for compute-intensive operations
- Implement proper error tracking and monitoring

## Conclusion

MoodflixMobile is a feature-rich mobile application that provides a personalized movie-watching experience. With its mood-based recommendations, social features, and watch party functionality, it offers a unique value proposition in the crowded streaming market. The application is built with modern technologies and follows best practices for performance, security, and user experience.
