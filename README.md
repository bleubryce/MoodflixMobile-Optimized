## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see the [Documentation](./documentation.md) file.

## Error Handling & Logging

- All errors are routed through a centralized ErrorHandler, which logs to Sentry in production and only logs to the console in development.
- Custom error classes (e.g., CacheError, DatabaseError, CacheNotConfiguredError, UnknownEntityError) are used for more granular error handling.
- User-facing errors are surfaced in a friendly way via error boundaries and UI notifications.
- Console logs are suppressed in production builds.
- Sentry DSN is required in the environment for error reporting.

## Troubleshooting

### Expo Simulator Timeout (xcrun code 60)

**Issue:**

xcrun exited with non-zero code: 60 â€“ The iOS simulator timed out when attempting to open the Expo URL.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Restarted the iOS simulator:
   ```sh
   xcrun simctl shutdown all
   xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"
   ```
2. Verified no stale processes on port 8081:
   ```sh
   lsof -i :8081
   ```
3. Restarted Metro with a clean cache:
   ```sh
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

**Outcome:**

Metro started successfully; no further timeout or port conflicts observed. The app is now ready to launch with `i` from the Expo CLI.

**Next Steps:**
- Press `i` in the Expo CLI to open the app in the iOS Simulator.
- If any error reappears, capture the full stack trace for further troubleshooting.
